          <p>The first time I tried a cardamom bun from Juno the Bakery in Copenhagen, The plush, buttery, strongly spiced bun both sweet and salty was the best pastry I had ever tasted. I would move to Copenhagen for Juno (in fact, I’m thinking about it). This put me on a cardamom spree: I made cardamom syrup, cardamom chai, and cardamom scones. I experimented to recreate the Juno bun, trying and tweaking multiple recipes and journeying to  Indian grocery stores to find cardamom pods.  </p>
          <p>During my cardamom obsession (which is still ongoing), I became curious about cardamom - where did it come from? Why was it in so many savory South Asian dishes, and yet so popular in Scandinavian pastry? Cardamom is native to India. The first evidence of cardamom in Scandanavia comes from a medieval text called Libellus de Arte Coquina (The Little Book of Cooking Art), from the early 13th century. The recipe that lists cardamom is for a “Lords Sauce.” </p>
          <p style="text-align:center">One takes cloves and nutmeg, cardamom, pepper, cinnamon – that is canel – and ginger, all in equal amounts, except that there should be as much canel as all the other spices; and add twice as much toasted bread as of everything else, and grind them all together, and blend with strong vinegar, and place it in a cask. This is a lordly sauce, and it is good for half a year.</pstyle="text-align:center">
          <p>I examined the New York Times cooking page to see what the most common ingredients are in recipes with cardamom. Almost all of the spices in the Lord’s Sauce - except for nutmeg - are in the top ten ingredients paired with cardamom. The flavor combinations are still popular today. </p>

           <p>In Scotland, the period of persecution of witches was much longer, and much more deadly. The University of Edinburgh created a database of people accused of witchcraft in Scotland between and 1563 and 1736. They have identified 3,837 people accused of witchcraft. The fates of only 305 witches were recorded, but of those, 205 were executed. </p>

          <p>You also might think of witchcraft trials in Europe as rather medieval. However, this is a misconception. These people - mostly women - were accused as witches after the end of the Middle Ages, starting with the <a href = 'https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/07/witchcraft-economics-reformation-catholic-protestant-market-share' target="_blank">protestant reformation</a>. </p>
          <p>They were of varying social status, age, and occupation. The most common form of torture for the witches was sleep deprivation. Fatigue-driven hallucinations caused them to confess to crimes they probably did not commit. </p>
          <p>The peaks of witch prosecutions are at the same as the five nationwide witch hunts in Scotland.</p>

          <p>In 1735, the parliament of Great Britan passed The Witchcraft Act. The act made it a crime to accuse any human of witchcraft. This ended the hunting and executing of witches in Scotland.</p>

          </p>Also, I found that many of the top ten ingredients are important in cakes and sweets.
