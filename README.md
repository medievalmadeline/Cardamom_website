Cardamom, queen of spices since the bronze age

I was curious about cardamom. it is my favorite spice, but it is not very popular in the US. It is very popular in both South Asia and Scandanavia. I wanted to know why and how, and about how cardamom is used today. 

I decided to use the NYT recipes because people seem to like the recipes. I was able to search for cardamom in the search bar and find all of the recipes in the NYT with cardamom as an ingredient. I then scraped the names of all of the recipes, and the ingredient list for each recipe. I practiced using the new scraping techniques we have learned. 

The hardest part of this project was finding the ingredients in the ingredientlist. For example, if the recipe said 1 1/2 cups flour, or 2 tablespoons melted butter, I just needed to get 'butter' and 'flour'. I found a food dictionary online and matched up the ingredients with the list. If there was a match, it collected the item from the food list. This did not work extremely well, for example I had 150 recipes with 'gin' and almost a hundred with 'pie'. I realized that the issue was that for the ingredient 'piece of ginger', it was grabbing 'gin', 'pie', and 'ginger'. Also, every time it said 'teaspoon' it recorded 'tea'. And the food dictionary did not have 'ghee' in it. I deleted these odd cases from my table and added a few words to the food dictionary. 

My next challenge was the graph that I made in figma. I made a beautiful graph in figma starting from a datawrapper svg. It was beautiful, but there was a bug in figma2html that made it so that it would never look good on my html page. :(

I gave up on that and instead made my graphs in flourish. 

I had wanted to make a map of the movement of cardamom and perhaps a timeline of the spread of it, but I was not able to do that. I wanted to spend more time on the writing part. In the future I need to dedicate more time to the story as well as the graphs. I also wanted to incorporate drawings into the story. I still feel like it needs drawings or pictures or something else besides my little bar graphs.
